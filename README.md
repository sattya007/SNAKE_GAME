# Project: Snake Game

The Snake Game project is a Python-based game that involves a snake navigating a grid to eat food and grow longer. The game consists of a main function called main.py and three classes: Scoreboard, Food, and Snake_Part. Here is a description of each component and its functionalities:

## Main Function (main.py):

Sets the background color of the game.
Handles collisions and failures of other subclasses, such as Food, Scoreboard, etc.
## Scoreboard Class:

Responsible for managing the current score.
Implements functions for incrementing the score.
Contains a game_over function to handle game over scenarios.
Provides an update function to display the updated score on the game screen.
## Food Class:

Manages the shape and color of the food in the game.
Implements corresponding functions to set the shape and color of the food.
## Snake_Part Class:

Handles the creation of the snake in the game.
Implements movement functions to move the snake up, down, left, and right.
Manages the color of the snake.
The Snake Game project, built using Python programming language, offers an engaging gaming experience where players control a snake, eat food to grow, and try to achieve the highest score possible. With its modular structure and separate classes for scoreboard, food, and snake parts, the game can be easily extended and customized.
